(using MacOS)

1. What's your computer's IP address for its current Internet connection? (Bonus: how can you tell the difference between your Ethernet IP and your wireless IP if you have both connections active?)
  ipconfig getifaddr en0 for wireless, and ipconfig getifaddr en1 for ethernet connection

2. How can you determine the IP address associated with a given host name?
  nslookup "hostname"

3. How can you determine the host name(s) associated with a given IP address?
  nslookup "IP-address"

4. How can you copy a file from one computer to another? Or more to the point, if you create a file on the Kali virtual machine and you want to put it someplace where you can save it, like your your Math/CS account on mantis.mathcs.carleton.edu, how do you go about it from the Kali command-line interface?
  scp (I tried but failed to understand the details behind this)

5. How can you tell whether there's a process listening on a given port (e.g. port 80 or port 22) on a given host?
  lsof -nP -iTCP -sTCP:LISTEN | grep <port-number>

6. How can you tell which ports have processes listening on them on a given host?
  lsof -nP -iTCP -sTCP:LISTEN; OR (not sure which one works best) netstat -p tcp -van | grep '^Proto\|LISTEN'

7. How can you retrieve and save a given web page (say http://google.com/ or http://carleton.edu/) in a file on your system?
  curl -O <url link> OR wget <the link> -O <filePath>

8. How can you view the HTTP headers sent back from a specified web server when you request one of its pages?
  curl -IL <url link>

9. [Super bonus question] Is there a command-line-only way to view the HTTP headers that *my* computer sends when I run the commands in the previous two questions?
  curl -Ivs <url link> > /dev/null : -I (Totally not sure if this is what was expected but...)
